// TestTheAdapterRaisesEveryLIHookTheNativeHandlerDoes is a source-level assertion, and it exists

//
// Only one of pfcp/handler and pfcp/adapter runs in a deployment — `enableUPFAdapter` chooses, and
// the chart's default chooses the adapter. So a Lawful Interception hook present in one of them is
// a hook whose presence depends on configuration, and the agency's product depends on it with no
// way for anyone to notice.
//
// That is not hypothetical. This package's establishment-response handler carried **none** of the
// three hooks the native one has. With the adapter selected, the SMF still set the DUPL bit on the
// FARs — so the UPF duplicated a targeted subscriber's traffic — but never sent the ActivateTask
// that authorises it. The CC-POI held no task for that session and dropped every copy as
// unattributable, and no establishment record was ever produced. From the SMF's side nothing had
// failed, so nothing raised a fault.
//
// The guard derives its expectation from the native handler rather than from a list, so a fourth
// hook added there fails this test until the adapter gets it too.
