// TestTheConfiguredEndpointServesAnUnnamedDestinationOnly is the decision the three
// destination outcomes are one of, asserted where it is made.
//
// A task that names **no** destination is a gap the provisioning function left, and the
// configured endpoint fills it: that is the case every deployment predating TS 33.128's
// destination requirement is in, and it stays served.
//
// A task that names destinations and yields no X2 endpoint is an assertion this element
// cannot honour, and the live shape of it is a warrant naming an X3-only destination —
// the CC half of a warrant whose IRI half this element produces. Substituting the
// configured MDF2 there sends an agency's signalling to an endpoint the warrant never
// named. The two used to be one test, an empty resolved list, and they are different
// facts.
