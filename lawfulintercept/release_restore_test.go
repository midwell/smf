// TestARestoredReleaseIsReportableAgainAndRetasksNothing is the effect the producer's
// branch test could only assert as a function call.
//
// The subject is what RestoreInterception *does*, and the previous round got the answer
// wrong in its comment rather than in its code. It called triggerCC and its doc said the
// triggers were re-installed. Every reachable caller runs after releaseTunnel has nilled
// sc.Tunnel, so sessionUPFs returns nothing and triggerCC returns before planning
// anything: the call was unreachable on every branch while the comment asserted it had
// run, and the producer test stubbed the whole function and counted it, so nothing
// anywhere established which of the two halves was real.
//
// One half is real. LiReleaseReported goes back to false, so the release that eventually
// happens is reported rather than suppressed as a duplicate of one that never occurred —
// without it the agency's record of the session ends at a failed attempt, permanently.
