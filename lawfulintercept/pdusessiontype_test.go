// `smfEstablishment` builds the record's pDUSessionType as
// `iri.PDUSessionType(sc.SelectedPDUSessionType)` — a direct cast from the NAS value, with no
// member-by-member assertion between the two definitions.
//
// **A direct cast is a correspondence claim with nothing behind it.** It states that TS 24.501's
// PDU session types and TS 33.128's `PDUSessionType` number the concept identically, in a form
// that cannot be checked and does not fail when they stop agreeing — which is the same claim a
// conversion function makes, minus the place to write the assertion. That the claim is true today
// is a fact about the current releases of both documents, not a property of this code.
//
// It is also the construct that produced both handover defects: `handoverCause` cast NGAP's
// cause value straight into the record type, and `handoverType` cast NGAP's handover type. Both
// were found by a delivered record being wrong.
//
// So the cast stays — per the change's design, replacing it with a switch would add a mapping
// nobody needs and a `default` arm whose value would be a guess — and what was missing is this.
// The shape is `amf/ngap`'s TestTheCauseMappingIsTotalOverNGAP: derive from both definitions by
// name, then assert the code agrees.

// ts33128Module locates the TS 33.128 ASN.1 module inside the pinned `li` module.
//
// Read from the module cache rather than copied here, so the assertion follows the pin: bumping
// `li` to a release built against a later TS 33.128 changes what this checks against, which is
// the point. A second copy in this repository would be a transcription with nothing keeping it
// honest.
//
// **Fatal, not skipped.** A skip is a green run that checked nothing, and this is the only thing
// standing between a later release of either document and every PDU session establishment record
// naming the wrong session type.
