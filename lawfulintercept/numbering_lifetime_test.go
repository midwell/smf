// TestNumberingReturnsToZeroWhenEveryWarrantIsWithdrawn is the assertion that makes the
// numbering-leak class detectable, rather than a test of one leak.
//
// Three separate defects in this workstream were the same shape: a numbering context created
// for a (warrant, subject) pair and never released — by a relabel, by a modification, by a
// withdrawal that took a different path. Each was found by reading code, none by a test, and
// each was invisible in operation: the element keeps numbering correctly, delivery keeps
// working, and the only symptom is an entry per subject per warrant held for the life of the
// process. A long-lived element accumulates them until it dies and takes every warrant it
// holds with it.
//
// What closes the class rather than the instance is the invariant: **an element holding no
// tasking holds no numbering.** It is cheap to state, it is true at every point where
// interception has stopped, and any future path that creates a context without releasing it
// fails here whether or not anybody thought of that path.
//
// Deliberately over two warrants and several subjects each. One warrant with one subject can
// pass by accident — a release keyed on the wrong thing still empties a map with one entry.
