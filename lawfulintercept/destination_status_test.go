// TestTheX1AnswerCarriesThisElementsOwnDeliveryFault asserts the wiring, not the mechanism.

// li/x1 renders deliveryFault when it is given a reachability answer, and that is tested
// there. What this element has to get right is *supplying* it: without the option wired into
// newX1Server, the X1 endpoint answers activeAndWorking for an endpoint this same element is
// reporting unreachable over ReportDestinationIssue — a remedy that exists in the library and
// not in the element, which is the class of miss this whole change is about.
//
// So it goes through newX1Server, the constructor Init uses, for the reason the bulk-operation
// test gives: a second copy of the wiring is exactly where a supplied answer stops being
// supplied without anything failing to compile.
