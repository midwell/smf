// A fail-safe window says how long silence must last before it means absence, and the
// POI's minTriggerKeepalive floor protects that window from the operator's side. It
// protects nothing if the sending side cannot keep the cadence: signalled one after
// another, each bounded only by a peer timeout, a round takes as long as the sum of its
// failures. A healthy point of interception sharing a triggering function with enough
// unreachable ones is then signalled at intervals its own window was chosen to read as
// absence — so it purges live tasking and reports that its triggering function went
// silent, which is true of the interval and false of the cause.

// endpoint too; it just does it too late, so a count assertion passes against the defect.
