//
// The two used to be neighbouring statements at each place a restart is detected: the discard,
// then upstream's restoration. That order is the whole of what stops a restored session covered
// by a content task from forwarding at a restarted point of interception while the stale claims
// still say it is tasked — `plan` then finds the triple claimed, installs nothing, and this
// element reports the interception as running. Wrapping the hook makes the order a property of
// the only way restoration can be reached, so a new detection path cannot leave the discard out.
//
// A node that is not a point of interception, and an element whose interception is not running,
// restore exactly as without this. A node that cannot be matched or ruled out is not restored
// while that lasts: the restoration is withheld, any restoration still running for an earlier
// restart of that node is stopped, and settling is retried after each name refresh for
// maxUndecidableRounds. Then the node's sessions are released instead, so the subscriber
// re-establishes rather than holding a session that carries nothing. Restoring it would let
// traffic flow at a point of interception that may still be recorded as tasked.
//
// The returned hook runs on the caller's goroutine, which holds UpfLock. It resolves the node's
// address, which every call site did under that lock before, and then waits for the node's
// restart lock, whose holders do no lookups of their own: the retry resolves before taking it,
// and the hooks are handed an address. Restore resolves the node again itself, which after the
// gate's own lookup is an answer from the cache. The work of restoring or releasing runs on
