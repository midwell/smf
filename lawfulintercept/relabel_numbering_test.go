// TestARelabelReleasesTheSupersededLabelsNumbering is the IRI-POI half of the numbering
// lifetime, and the half a relabel exposed.
//
// The numbering is keyed by the *delivery* XID — the provisioned ProductID where a task
// carries one — so a ModifyTask that moves the label moves the key. Every record from
// that point carries the new label, so the contexts under the old one are stranded: one
// entry per session this warrant had records for, held for the life of the process. The
// declaration said the numbering belongs to the XID, "which a modification never
// changes", which was true of the task XID and not of the thing the numbering is
// actually keyed by.
//
// The other half is why the release cannot simply be unconditional: a modification that
// leaves the labelling alone must release nothing, because those contexts are the ones
// this task's own next record will number in, and re-issuing a number the mediation
// function has already seen is how loss is signalled on this interface.
