// ReleaseSessionsOnUPF releases every session anchored on a restarted UPF instead of restoring it,

//
// It is for a restoration that was held back and cannot go ahead. Leaving the sessions in place is
// not an option: once the restart is recorded nothing need detect it again, and the UE observed
// nothing and will go on using a session that carries nothing. Releasing them is what lets each
// UE establish a working one, through the same path RestoreSessionsOnUPF uses for sessions the
// node would not accept.
//
// It takes part in the same one-run-per-node bookkeeping as the restoration, so a restoration for a
// later restart stops it, and it stops a restoration for an earlier one.
//
// Sessions are found by the address they were anchored under, which the caller supplies: the
// node's name may not resolve now, and its last known address is the one its sessions are keyed
// by. With no address at all there is nothing to find, and that is reported rather than counted
// as a release of nothing. Runs asynchronously, as RestoreSessionsOnUPF does.
