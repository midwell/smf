// deletion times out or fails, the session is restored to service and nothing put the
// interception state back. Two silences followed. LiReleaseReported stayed set, so the
// release that eventually happened was suppressed as a duplicate of one that never
// occurred, and the agency's record of the session ended at the failed attempt. And the
// triggers stayed withdrawn while the session went on duplicating, so its content was
// discarded by the POI as untasked.

// siblings did: the mediation function saw a release record and then silence, and which
