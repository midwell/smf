// The Lawful Interception teardown hooks, reached through package variables so
// that a test can observe which paths call them.
//
// A test cannot do that by activating the subsystem: `active` is package-private
// to lawfulintercept, and Init needs mTLS material and a TCP bind that this
// package's tests have no business standing up. Without a seam the hooks are
// silent no-ops in every test, so a path that stopped calling them would look
// exactly like a path that calls them — which is how two teardown paths came to
// be missing them for as long as they were.
//
// The seam lives here rather than as test-only API on lawfulintercept, because
// what needs asserting is which of *this* package's paths call the hooks, not
// anything about the subsystem behind them.
//
// Production behaviour is unchanged: these are the same two functions, and both
// remain silent no-ops when LI is not configured.

// ReportEstablishmentFailure ends the interception state of a PDU session whose PFCP
// establishment failed, at the one point every such failure reaches: the state machine's
// create-failure handler, which rejects the UE and removes the context. A UPF that refused, a
// request that timed out, an adapter error and a verdict collected across several UPFs all
// arrive there, and none of them reaches the producer's rejectEstablishment.
//
// **What the agency already holds decides the record.** The establishment record is emitted
// when the anchor UPF accepts, before the verdict from the other UPFs is in, because only the
// anchor's response carries the F-TEID the record describes. So a create can fail after its
// establishment was reported. That session is reported released, which is what happened to
// it: a failed-establishment record after an establishment record would leave the agency
// holding both. A session whose establishment was never reported gets the failed-establishment
// record, with the cause the reject to the UE carries.
//
// **The triggers are withdrawn either way.** The CC trigger is installed at every UPF that
// accepted, the anchor or not, so a create that failed can hold one whether or not its
// establishment was reported, and the context removed after this is the last thing that could
// have withdrawn it. Withdrawing from a session that holds none does nothing.

// leaves the trigger installed, and this element keeps a POI alive while it
// believes that POI holds tasking it installed, so the keepalives that trigger
// earns are what stop the POI's fail-safe from ever reclaiming it. Naming the
// pair once makes a teardown path that calls only one of them visible as an

//
// Not the triggers. By the time any caller runs, releaseTunnel has nilled the tunnel, so
// there are no serving UPFs to re-task and the withdrawal already acknowledged by the
// POI stands. See lawfulintercept.RestoreInterception for why re-installing from here
// would produce a trigger that matches nothing while the element believed interception
// was running.
//
