// TestEveryTeardownPathReportsAndUntasks pins the call sites, which is what the existing coverage
// cannot do.
//
// `reportAndUntask` exists so that a session ending is reported to the agency and its content
// trigger withdrawn from the UPF, on *every* path that ends one. The only test of it calls it
// directly — so it passes whether the function is reached from five paths, from one, or from none,
// which is exactly how a missing call site survives. Two of the five had a behavioural test; the
// other three had nothing at all.
//
// A path that tears a session down while leaving the interception state that session created is
// the shape `li-content-interception` forbids outright: the trigger stays installed at a UPF for a
// session that no longer exists, and the agency is never told the session ended.
//
// This is a source-level assertion because the alternative is five integration fixtures for a
// property that is really about placement. It fails when a call site is removed, and it fails when
// a teardown path is renamed — at which point the person renaming it decides whether the
// obligation moved with it.
