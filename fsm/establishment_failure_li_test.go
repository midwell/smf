// Every PFCP establishment failure reaches the create-failure handler -- a UPF that refused, a
// request that timed out, an adapter error, a verdict collected across several UPFs -- so that is
// where Lawful Interception has to hear of it. Before, the record hung off a PFCP send-error
// handler the native establishment path no longer used, so a tasked subject's failed establishment
// produced no record, and one that failed after the anchor accepted left its establishment record
// and its trigger standing.
//
// The hook must run while the context exists: the record and the withdrawal both read the session,
// and the handler removes it.
